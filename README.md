# 🛡️ AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System Using Suricata and Llama 3

## 📖 Overview

The AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (AI-NIDS) is a real-time cybersecurity solution designed to monitor network traffic, detect malicious activities, analyze security threats, and provide intelligent threat explanations using Artificial Intelligence.

The system leverages **Suricata** for intrusion detection, **Llama 3** running locally through **Ollama** for AI-powered threat analysis, **SQLite** for secure data storage, and **Flask** for a web-based Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard.

By combining traditional intrusion detection techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs), the project enables security analysts to understand attacks more effectively and respond to incidents faster.

# 🎯 Objectives

* Monitor network traffic in real time.
* Detect suspicious and malicious network activities.
* Generate intrusion alerts using Suricata.
* Store security events in a database.
* Analyze threats using Llama 3.
* Provide AI-generated threat explanations.
* Recommend mitigation strategies.
* Visualize attack trends through an interactive dashboard.

---

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Modern computer networks are continuously exposed to cyber threats such as:

* Port Scanning
* Brute Force Attacks
* Malware Communication
* Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
* Unauthorized Access Attempts
* Network Reconnaissance

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems can identify attacks but often require security analysts to manually interpret alerts and determine appropriate responses.

This project enhances conventional intrusion detection by integrating Artificial Intelligence capable of automatically explaining security alerts, assessing risks, and recommending mitigation actions.

# 💡 Proposed Solution

The proposed solution combines a signature-based intrusion detection system with an AI-powered threat analysis engine.

# 🧠 Role of Llama 3

Unlike traditional IDS solutions that only generate alerts, this system uses Llama 3 to explain security incidents.

### Example

#### Suricata Alert

```text
ET SCAN Potential Nmap Scan
```

#### Llama 3 Analysis

```text
Threat Explanation:
A host is attempting to discover open ports and services.

Risk Level:
Medium

Recommendations:
- Monitor source IP
- Restrict exposed services
- Enable firewall monitoring
```
